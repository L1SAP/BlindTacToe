# # Blind Tac Toe

A twist on classic Tic Tac Toe — players can’t see their moves until the game ends.  
Clicking an occupied cell results in an instant loss!

## Features
- Hidden moves (revealed only at the end)
- Instant loss on invalid clicks 
- Win highlight (green for winning combo)
- Reset button to play again

## How to Play
- Open `BlindTacToe.html`
- Take turns as X and O
- Don’t click a cell twice!
- At the end, moves are revealed and the winner is shown


## 💡 Why I Built This

A fun project turning a simple game like Tic Tac Toe with a hidden twist.
 
The idea of **not seeing your moves** until the end forces players to rely on memory, and it creates a fun surprise at the end of reveal. 

I also wanted a beginner-friendly project to practice working with JavaScript, the DOM, and CSS.
